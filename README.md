# Benfords-Law_VideoAnalysis
The Benford's Law Video Analysis project is a Python tool that leverages Benford's Law to differentiate between original and AI-generated videos. The script extracts frames from a video, analyzes the first digits of pixel values in these frames, and creates histograms to visualize digit occurrences.
